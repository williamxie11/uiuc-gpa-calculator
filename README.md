UIUC GPA Calculator is a simple web application that calculates a semester's GPA. I made this early Sophomore year to learn how to use KnockoutJS for one of my internships! It is also one of the first "full" web applications I've ever made.

I have plans to totally refactor this sometime to align with current standards, practices, and what I've learned in the years since making this. Coming soon!
